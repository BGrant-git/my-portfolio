			' When I achieved confidence in my web dev skills I got in contact with a start-up catering company about establishing their online identity. While they had their social media all set up, I knew they would profit from having their own website and I saw this as a great opportunity to apply my new learned abilities to a real-life and professional use case. ',

			"	They didn't want the layout for their site to follow any sort of templates, so the design was a fluid and creative process, and developing the site with Gatsby was ideal as I felt that I could build on the knowledge and confidence I gained from my own Gatsby shop project. I was sure I could deliver to them a functional and accessible site, and the site makes use of graphql, styled-components, global contexts, Google (and soon Shopify) API, Github, custom DNS records and more.",

			'This GatsbyJS project was my first time applying all of the web developing skills I had learned into a React project. I decided to make a clothes shop as it would present opportunities to apply learned skills and learn some new ones. Initially, I started to code the app using create-react-app, but I was advised to use a framework like Gatsby, advice I took. ',

			'As well as getting very comfortable with this JavaScript framework, I also learned how to use the Shopify CMS to provide mock items for the shop, graphql to retrieve them, and Netlify/Github to host it.',
