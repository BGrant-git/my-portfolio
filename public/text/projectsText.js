			"Once I was more confident in my web dev skills I got in contact with a catering start-up company about establishing their online identity. While they had their social media's all set up, I knew they would profit from their own website and I saw this as a great opportunity to apply my new learned abilities to a real-life and professional use case. ",

			"	They didn't want the layout for their site to follow any sort of templates, so the design was a fluid process, and developing the site with GatsbyJS was ideal as I felt that I could build on the knowledge and confidence I gained from my own Gatsby shop project. I was sure I could deliver to them a functional and accessible site, and the site makes use of graphql, styled-components, global contexts, Google (and soon Shopify) API, Github, custom DNS records and more.",

			'This GatsbyJS project was my first time applying all of the web developing skills I had learned into a ReactJS project. I decided to make a clothes shop as it would present opportunities to apply learned skills and learn some new. Initially, I started to code the app using create-react-app, but an experiended dev friend of mine recommended to use a framework like Gatsby, advice I took. ',

			"As well as getting very comfortable with this JavaScript framework, I also learned how to use the Shopify CMS to provide mock items for the shop, graphql to retrieve them, React's global context to display them, and Netlify/Github to host it.",
